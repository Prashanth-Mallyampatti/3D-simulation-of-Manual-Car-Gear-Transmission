# 3D-simulation-of-Manual-Car-Gear-Transmission
A 3D simulation of Manual Car Gear Transmission using OpenGL
    
    > OpenGL using Visual Studio in C++ was used to for animation, illumination, and 3D rendering.
    > Each gear working and their metrics was implemented using keyboard controls.
    > Metrics such as Speed, Velocity, Power, and Torque and their dependencies were shown at various levels using dynamically controlled animation.
